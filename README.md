# SQL Project 3: Database for Ticket Sales

A project analyzing data relating to ticket sales for a range of events. As with SQL Project 2, I explored each table to identify fields in common between the tables, wrote five business questions and then wrote queries to address each question (with additional queries to provide context and check my results were reasonable), as well as the actual results. 

_Please note that since the notebook has been downloaded from the DataCamp platform, and it contains code, the 'Code' tab of the notebook.ipynb file does not contain the code I wrote, but rather the code for the notebook._

# Documents in this repository

In this repository, besides this README document, there are many files. The original raw data files which contain data relating the the ticket sales for a range of events and event types over the course of a year (2008) are uploaded. 

The notebook contains the code I wrote to preview the dataset, the report writing I did between queries, and the results of those queries. 

# Results 

I was able to find answers to all of the questions I asked; more information relating to this can be found in the notebook file (on the 'preview' setting), including the results of the queries and what the results suggest.
